Basics:

<Red> your active cell - It affects the number of active cells you can place on the board, as well as the status the their neighbors (including diagonal ones)

<Light Red> Your territory - It only affects the number of active cells you can place on the board

<Blue> Your enemy's active cell

<Light Blue> Your enemy's territory

<Yellow Empty Square> Ghost - Cells with yellow borders are your active cells in the next turn

Goal: Eliminate blue

Rules:
You can only place a cell on or near any of your territory and your active cells

Unlike blue territory, you cannot kill any blue active cell by directly placing one of your cells on top. Instead, you need three of your active cells around (including diagonal ones)
