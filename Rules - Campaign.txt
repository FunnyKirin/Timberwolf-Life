Basics:

<Red> your active cell - It affects the number of active cells you can place on the board, as well as the status the their neighbors (including diagonal ones)

<Light Red> Your territory - It only affects the number of active cells you can place on the board

<Blue> Your enemy's active cell

<Light Blue> Your enemy's territory

<Yellow Empty Square> Ghost - Cells with yellow borders are your active cells in the next turn

Goal: Eliminate blue

Rules:
You can only place a cell on or near any of your territory and your active cells

Unlike blue territory which you can directly occupy, you needs two active cells to convert a blue active cell directly. Better yet, try to surround a blue active cell with three of your active cells
